The project analyzes the CO2 and temperature patterns of the five most populated states in the USA (Florida, Illinois, Texas, New York and California)

The project was completed in July 2017 & posted on Github May 2018

Two separate time-series datasets were used for the purpose of the project. The first dataset, “GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv” consisted of average monthly temperatures dated from 1855 to 2013 from states across the globe.
